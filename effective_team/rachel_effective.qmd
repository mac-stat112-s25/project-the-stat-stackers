##Takeaways

The most important thing when working in a team, is to listen really well and accept feedback gracefully. The article frames this as listening with humility. I also agree that asking questions is a good way to be an effective team member. 

Try to challenge assumptions that you have as a team member. It doesn't serve the team to stubbornly stick to ideas that you have about something, whether it's the thing you're working on or something else. 

When disagreeing, be sure to do so respectfully and without holding a grudge. It's totally normal to disagree, but make sure that doesn't negatively impact team efficiency and relationships. The article suggests widening the circle of empathy as a strategy for this.
